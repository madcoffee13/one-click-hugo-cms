Suman was only two years old, when she lost her mother. Since her father had a busy schedule of working on a ship for at least six to nine months, he decided to re-marry. However Suman’s step-mother was very strict and made the girl work extremely hard. By the time she was ten years old, Suman was made to do all sorts of jobs like washing utensils and clothes, sweeping and mopping the floor, cutting vegetables, getting water from the well and making the beds. As if that was not enough, Suman's step-mother gave her very little to eat and sometimes only a bowl of soup with a stale slice of bread. However Suman never complained as she was always anxious to please her step-mother.  

Suman was known to be a very kind and gentle person, just like her father! She also loved feeding all the birds and the animals that lived in the forest. With her sweet mannerisms, and a magical touch, Suman was able to nurse a wounded bird that had accidentally fallen from the nest or affectionately applied some medicinal herbs on a deer’s foot. Every-one adored sweet Suman. 

One day, Suman’s step-mother called her. “Get me water in this pot,” she snapped. “Also, make sure that not a drop of water is wasted, is it clear? Now go, and don’t come home till you finish your task.” Suman just didn’t know what to do. The earthen pot which her step-mother had given her was full of holes! Suman went into the forest and lowered the pot in the well. But no matter how much she tried, the water kept gushing out. Poor Suman’s arms hurt as she kept trying again and again but in vain. Finally she sat down in the green meadow and started crying. Suddenly a high pitched voice asked Suman-"my dear! What happened? Can I help you in any way?" Suman looked up to see a big frog sitting next to her. "Yes, I definitely need some help," Suman said and she narrated her ordeal to the frog. "Quickly wipe your face dear. I have a solution to your problem. Wait here, while I call all my brothers to help you!” “But how will you assist me?” Little Suman asked. “Just wait and see!" 

The huge frog croaked loudly as he jumped into the well. Within five minutes, at least six frogs had gathered around the well. The frog explained his plans to his younger siblings: "See this earthen pot is full of holes. All you have to do is to sit as tightly as you can and cover these holes with your body and long limbs." Within the next few minutes, each frog had taken his respective place on the pot. "Now Suman," the elder frog croaked "you can fill this pot." Wiping her tears and smiling gratefully at the frogs, Suman did as she was told. Then, she carefully carried the pot home. She then poured the water into a large drum. Once she had set the earthen pot on the kitchen table, all the frogs jumped off the pot and quickly went leaping back into the forest. Suman's step-mother was surprised to see that Suman had actually managed to carry out this difficult task! She asked her quite a number of times but Suman's only reply was: "I found a way mother." 

A few days later, Suman's mother came up with another cumbersome idea. "Suman, go and chop wood in the forest. But mind you, you have to get the heavy pile all by yourself, as I am not going to give you a rope to tie up the logs! Now, stop staring at me you fool! There is no wood at home." Poor Suman worked hard all morning in the forest. Her arms ached; her dress was drenched in sweat but she worked untiringly till she had gathered a big heap in-front of her. Suman’s stomach was growling with hunger, as she hadn't eaten anything that day. "What shall I do now?" She wondered aloud. 

Just then, a long, green snake was passing by. In a clear voice, the snake asked her: "Suman, what is the matter?" When the snake heard her story, his gigantic eyes gleamed and he hissed out: "Is that all that is worrying you dear girl? I will lie down in a straight line and all you have to do is to pile up the wood on me! Once you are ready, I will make a coil of my body and wrap the pieces, so that it is easier for you to carry these logs. Once you reach home; I will quickly wriggle out and go back to the jungle, unseen." "I think this is a splendid idea!" Suman spoke enthusiastically. Soon, she was home with the pile of wood which she neatly kept in one corner of the kitchen. Suman's step-mother couldn't believe her eyes. "I just can't understand how this girl managed to do this difficult job on her own! Let me see. This time, I will think of an even tiresome task for you!"  

On another occasion, Suman's step-mother called her and told her: "I have mixed all types of daal in this plate. Sort them out in different groups and get this plate back in ten minutes. Go at once!" 

Once again, the lass settled down in the forest and with her tiny fingers, tried to sort out the daals in various groups in the plate itself. But she just couldn't manage this as all the grains either kept slipping off or getting stuck to each-other. Poor Suman didn't know what to do! "What happened dear Suman? Can I assist you?" Suman looked up to see that a sparrow had hopped onto her lap. "Because of your ointment, my baby is much better now. Do you remember that she had accidently fallen off the nest and hurt her wing? Now, tell me, why are you looking so sad?" Suman explained the job which she had to carry out. "Is that all that is bothering you? It is a very simple job for me!" The pretty brown sparrow flew into a branch of a tree and began to chirp sweetly. Very soon, a dozen other sparrows had collected around her. Quickly, the sparrow explained what her friends had to do. They all flew down and smiling at Suman said: "We'll gladly work for you! You just sit back and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere in our forest." Within minutes, the group of sparrows had made neat heaps of daals - separating them into small groups in the plate itself. "Here you are dear, your plate is ready!" Thanking all the sparrows, Suman carefully carried the plate back home, annoying her wicked step-mother once again.

Within three days, the spiteful mother had another plan up her sleeve. "Here, take this bucket and go to the beach. Collect the foam that forms on top of the waves. Come home only after you have that foam in the bucket. Then, I will give you your breakfast! Get lost!" 

When Suman reached the beach, it was very hot. She waded into the cool water, carrying the bucket with her. She watched the waves roll in, then bent low, scooping the foam in her hands. But it disappeared the minute Suman had collected it! She kept on trying. This time, she was really all by herself on the vast beach. There were no birds, snakes or animals to lend her a hand. As poor Suman continued to try her luck, she noticed a ship coming closer and closer to the shore. She was extremely tired, hungry, thirsty and her arms ached as she had been standing under the scorching sun for almost an hour. "Just one more time. This time I will succeed..." Then, all of a sudden, everything became dark, as Suman crumpled in a heap, in the soft, golden sands. 

 Some-one was gently shaking her and calling out her name. "Suman, my dearest, what happened to you? How come you are lying over here? Your dress is not only torn but so filthy! I have come home as a surprise visit from the seas. I wanted to surprise you by coming a little earlier." Her father was talking to Suman, his voice was so soothing and calm, as he held her in his strong arms. Suman could hardly open her eyes, she was so weak...Seeing her plight, her father quickly carried her in a shaded spot near the shore, and getting a bottle of water out from his bag quickly splashed water on her face and also gave a fatigued Suman some cool water to drink. After she had revived, he spoke in a soft voice "you look so ill and have lost so much weight darling! Doesn't your mother take care of you?" Suman, then broke down, on hearing her father's kind words. Holding back her tears, Suman then narrated how her mother ill-treated her and didn't even give her any proper meal or snack. "I can imagine just looking at your condition how your mother has treated you so cruelly," her father spoke angrily. 

Suman's father was extremely furious by the time he reached home. Suman's mother tried her best to show how much she cared for “darling” Suman by patting and hugging her but Suman's father had already realized how nasty his wife had been. "I had got beautiful gifts for you but unfortunately you turned out to be very mean! While working on the ship, I constantly kept thinking that you must be taking good care of my baby girl," he cried out. "But I was absolutely wrong. You have done nothing but harassed this poor child!" Suman's step- mother tried to beg for pardon but her father was firm. "Now listen to me carefully, you good-for-nothing woman! After Suman recover's completely, I am taking her back with me to the ship. I don't wish to stay with a lady who is so unkind. Now go and prepare dinner for us." 

Within a week's time, Suman and her father-Captain Pereira left to go to England - never to return...
